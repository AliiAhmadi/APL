# APL

Ahmadi programming language is a language under development. This language is like high-level programming languages used today and it is a interpreted language. 
APL is also dynamically typed language. At this point only support structured and functional paradigm.

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not use this language in your projects. This language is for fun now :)

### Setup and use REPL

```zsh
# Clone APL source code.
git clone https://github.com/AliiAhmadi/APL.git
```

Navigate to APL directory and run tests.
```zsh
go test ./... -v
```

Now compile source and use executable file.
```zsh
go build -o APL
```

### Features

Now is the time to use it and doing some evaluation:

In APL we can define a new variable of any type with `def` keyword(even functions and closures - in following):

As you know to see value of a variable just type its identifier:

APL also support numerical calculations and most important operations will work with values or with identifiers (- / * +):
